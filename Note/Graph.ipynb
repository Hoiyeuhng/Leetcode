    "### Graph\n",
    "Graph is a set of points V and set of lines E (which connected the points in V).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points\n",
    "A set of Points. A point is a value (the value can be in n dimensions).\n",
    "Points are also called nodes and vertices.\n",
    "Points can come with labels, colors, values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines\n",
    "A set of Lines that connected the points. A line can connect a point to another point (between point a and point b) or a point to itself (between point a and point a, this kind of line is also called a loop). \n",
    "Lines are also called edges and arcs.\n",
    "Lines can come with directions, colors, values, etc.\n",

    "## Type of Graph\n",
    "There are many type of graph, and they are not mutually exclusive.\n",
